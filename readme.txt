You are free to move the system where you like once you know how the config
files work a little. I set it up like this so you have an easy go of it
being preconfigured mostly.

The database can be a pain. On some Linux I am unable to get even identical
library mariadb-client versions to connect on some Linus Distros. If JAS
(JegasCRM) is hanging in the very beginning its usually a database issue:
missing the mysql client files, the database is simply off, or that nasty
bit I described above; I've run into that connect problem a few times now
on FreePascal 3.0.0 and it seems to be distro specific but I haven't nailed
down what they have in common so the problem remains.
