We are grateful for all the artists who created ICON Libraries
for the general public and were kind enough to license their
creations under the LGPL! This allows JAS to be able to bundle
and distribute these icons which improves the appearance of 
JAS and allows users of JAS to get pretty fancy customizing 
their software. 

To make things easier for other folks to use these same ICON 
resources just as easy as the authors made getting them for
Jegas, LLC, we have bundled each LGPL Icon directory in WHOLE
both Zipped as the were downloaded originally and already
extracted so that they are ready to use for users of JAS.

Now some of these icons might be spread about the JAS icon theme 
folders as sometimes we have a spot for an icon that needs to be 
filled and no content - so we'll pick and choose the best fit
for whatever theme we are working on. This is another reason we
wanted to keep the original LGPL libraries intact so they
retain their original authors distribution configuration.
