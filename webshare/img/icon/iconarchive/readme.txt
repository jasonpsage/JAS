This folder contains icon archives downloaded from www.IconArchives.com

Each icon archive form this web site has it's own licensing terms. To honor them... Icon archive in this folder needs to be listed in JAS documentation with a Link to the icon author(s) when Released.

NOTE: The Original ZIP files are here from the author(s) but the directory structure and file names of the icons have been changed to match the requirements most of the other icons follow with regards to directory names being numeric indicators of the size of the icons contained.
