<table><tr><td><h1>501 Not Implemented</h1></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>5xx Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request. Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an objectcontaining an explanation of the error situation, and indicate whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. Likewise, user agents should display any included entity to the user. These response codes are applicable to any request method. The server either does not recognise the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request.</td></tr></table>
