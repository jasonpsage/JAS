<tr><td>4xx Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled. The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an objectcontaining an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included entity to the user. These are typically the most common error codes encountered while online. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, but that has not happened, and this code has never been used.</td></tr>
