    <tr><td>4xx Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled. The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should include an objectcontaining an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included entity to the user. These are typically the most common error codes encountered while online. Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is possible but has failed or not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication.</td></tr>
