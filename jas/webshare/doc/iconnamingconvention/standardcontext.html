    <table summary="Standard Contexts" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Directory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Actions</td><td>
Icons which are generally used in menus and dialogs for
interacting with the user.
	    </td><td>actions</td></tr><tr><td>Animations</td><td>
Animated images used to represent loading web sites, or other
background processing which may be less suited to more verbose
progress reporting in the user interface. Animations should be a PNG with
frames which are the size of the directory the animation is in, tiled in a
WxH grid. Implementations should determine the number of frames by dividing
the image into its frames, and iterating from left to right, wrapping to the
first frame, after rendering the last.
	    </td><td>animations</td></tr><tr><td>Applications</td><td>
Icons that describe what an application is, for use in the
Programs menu, window decorations, and the task list. These may
or may not be generic depending on the application and its
purpose. Applications which are to be considered part of the base desktop,
such as the calculator or terminal, should use the generic icons specified in
this specification, while more advanced applications such as web browsers and
office applications should use branded icons which still give the user an idea
of what function the application provides.
	    </td><td>apps</td></tr><tr><td>Categories</td><td>
Icons that are used for categories in the Programs menu, or
the Control Center, for separating applications, preferences, and
settings for display to the user.
	    </td><td>categories</td></tr><tr><td>Devices</td><td>
Icons for hardware that is contained within or connected to the
computing device. Naming for extended devices in this group, is of the form
&lt;primary function&gt;-&lt;manufacturer&gt;-&lt;model&gt;. This allows ease
of fallback to the primary function device name, or ones more targeted for
a specific series of models from a manufacturer. For example, a theme author
may want to provide icons for different phones. The specific model icons could
be named &#8220;<span class="quote">phone-samsung-t809</span>&#8221;, &#8220;<span class="quote">phone-motorola-rokr</span>&#8221;,
and &#8220;<span class="quote">phone-motorola-pebl</span>&#8221;. However, the theme must provide a phone
icon in the theme's style, so that devices not matching these models, will
still have an appropriate icon. An exception to this rule is that the
&#8220;<span class="quote">media</span>&#8221; icons do not need to include manufacturer names, as they
are generic items, and may be available from many manufacturers. As a result,
for media, the specific icons are to differentiate between different specific
types of media. For exmaple, an artist may wish to provide icons for BluRay,
DVD, HD-DVD, CD-ROM, and variations thereof. The specific media type icons
should be named in the form, &lt;primary function&gt;-&lt;specific format&gt;.
Some examples are &#8220;<span class="quote">media-optical</span>&#8221;, &#8220;<span class="quote">media-optical-bd</span>&#8221;
and &#8220;<span class="quote">media-optical-dvd</span>&#8221;.
	    </td><td>devices</td></tr><tr><td>Emblems</td><td>
Icons for tags and properties of files, that are displayed in the
file manager. This context contains emblems for such things as
&#8220;<span class="quote">read-only</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="quote">photos</span>&#8221;.
	    </td><td>emblems</td></tr><tr><td>Emotes</td><td>
Icons for emotions that are expressed through text chat
applications such as :-) or :-P in IRC or instant messengers.
	    </td><td>emotes</td></tr><tr><td>International</td><td>
Icons for international denominations such as flags.
	    </td><td>intl</td></tr><tr><td>MimeTypes</td><td>
Icons for different types of data, such as audio or image files.
	    </td><td>mimetypes</td></tr><tr><td>Places</td><td>
Icons used to represent locations, either on the local
filesystem, or through remote connections. Folders, trash, and
workgroups are some examples.
	    </td><td>places</td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>
Icons for presenting status to the user. This context contains
icons for warning and error dialogs, as well as for the current
weather, appointment alarms, and battery status.
