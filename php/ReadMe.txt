This folder is used to bring in PHP configuration
information and functions for use with Jegas libraries
and applications that need to work alongside or with 
PHP applications.

This folder serves as both a PHP repository of code 
and for configuration information specific to the applications
as well as Jegas Application Server. It basically allows
PHP applications and Jegas PHP functions to know where the 
JAS install is located and where resources are as well as the 
information required to connect to any databases including but 
not limited to the Jegas Application Server/CRM database.
